# Predicting Nominal GDP of Canada using Time-Series Forecasting

## Description

I have implementing time-series forecasting techniques on the cleaned data(Cleaned using Excel). There are several types of models that can be used for time-series forecasting. For this project, I have used three types of techniques namely *Simple Moving Average*, *Exponential Smoothing* and *Arima*. The error values are later compared between the 3 techniques and decide the better fit with smaller error and wrapping by forecasting Nominal GDP for 10 years i.e. 2016-2025.

## Data Source

https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3610020801
Statistics Canada has provided the "Multifactor productivity, value-added, capital input and labour input in the aggregate business sector and major sub-sectors, by industry" data for 1961-2015.

## Technologies Used

The prediction analysis adopts the below tools and techniques including data preparation and preprocessing using Excel, timeseries forecasting using different algorithms like ARIMA, simple moving average in R studio (R language) and finally visualizing the results to get the timely estimates.
